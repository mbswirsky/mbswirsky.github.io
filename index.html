		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p class="text">
			There has been a recent challenge for the GIS community from former Oregon governor Kitzhaber, to help fight the roots of child poverty using GIS tools. The idea is to provide a spatial framework for aid organizations to integrate their efforts and pinpoint problem areas. Living in Portland myself, I am interested in exploring the sources of poverty in the city, as well as possible actions to mediate them.</p>
		<p class="text">
			I have assembled the following annotated bibliography to collect efforts to use GIS to solve poverty problems, as well as some background on poverty issues and some Portland-specific studies. Please use the links at the bottom of the page to submit questions or comments.</p>

			This paper attempts to formalize a conceptual data model for poverty studies, describing the linkage between spatial and non-spatial characteristics of individual entities, e.g. roads or neighborhoods, with their attributes, e.g. flood risk or education level. This linkage is divided into three types of relationships: relational within the database, topological, and spatially derived. This data model concept is derived from numerous other existant poverty studies, but it is noted that any conceptual framework must be tested by users to make sure it is useful.</p>

			This introduction to a collection of multi-dimension poverty studies outlines the major currently used multi-dimensional method of understanding the intricacies of poverty, the Alkire-Foster method. This method involves evaluating the amount of deprivation along one indicator and whether it meets a particular cutoff. The number of deprived indicators for each individual is counted and that is then turned into one data point, which is then aggregated to population level. This allows the data set to be composed of multiple partial-poverty indicators, so that it can be sliced and diced along many different poverty axes. This method is cited and used by many if not all workers in the multi-dimensional poverty space. This particular paper goes through the intricacies of the modeling and aggregation methodologies, as a guide for others.</p>

			This paper re-approaches the concept of the food desert - an area of a city more than a mile from a grocery store, by introducing the price point of healthy food. In Portland, many gentrifying neighborhoods are adding grocery stores with higher price points to serve the new affluent residents, turning food deserts into "food mirages." The availability of low-cost grocery stores was mapped out, and it was discovered that 81% of low-income residents live more than a mile from low-cost stores, putting them into the food mirage category, and 20% of low-income residents live more than a mile from any grocery store, putting them into true food deserts. Food deserts were concentrated east of I-205, while food mirages were concentrated in the close-in Eastside. The Westside of Portland tends to have fewer low-income residents and so the higher-priced grocery stores have less effect. This reinterpretation provides a real paradigm change in the way we think about food justice in cities.</p>

			This survey report documents the history of poverty in Portland as well as the efforts to reduce its impacts. Portland is referenced as a "best case" for urban poverty, with its history of progressive activism and policy. The existing inequalities are compared as relatively similar to national averages, while lower than those of other cities. Portland's major inequality problems are not concentrated in urban centers like other cities, but spread out because of high amounts of gentrification. This serves as a great foundational document for any further study I do of Portland poverty.</p>

			This source is an internal government report making observations about trends in the child welfare / foster care system along racial lines. Other studies have shown that entry into the foster care system was the biggest predictor of poorer outcomes for children down the road, so racial disparities, which were found in this study, are of particular importance. Significantly, this study is purely observational and does not attempt to identify any causal relationships. Perhaps geographic analysis could be used to find helpful correlations.</p>

			This article is a case study, and really an ethnography, of the homeless community known as Dignity Village, established in the Portland metro area. It documents the history of the Village, as well as its purposes of educating both its members and the public, providing a safe haven for those first entering homelessness, and acting as an example of self-sufficiency among the homeless population. The author worked closely with the leadership of the Village, and acted to provide grants as well as grant-writing skills to Village members. The partnership between the Village and the author's university (University of Washington, Vancouver,) also included technology teaching events to provide residents with abilities to apply for jobs online and manage finances with spreadsheets. Since many children who go through the foster care system end up homeless at some point in their lives, understanding alternative methods of coping with the burdens of homelessness and routes out of it is crucial.</p>

			This study focused on integrating collected census data into a GIS along with remote sensing data with training classification, using a combination of RADARSAT and Landsat Thematic Mapper. The study combined a GIS of city blocks with the tabulated census data, mostly involving floor and roofing materials and number of inhabitants per room. These were then converted to a poverty metric. The remote sensing data was given supervised training to distinguish land use, which was then merged with the census data. The result yielded two already-known pockets of poverty, and identified ten more areas that were then corroborated. This shows a real case study where a combination of remote sensing and ground data were used to extrapolate areas in need from known areas.</p>

			This is primarily a case study of successfully integrating tabular data into a GIS in order to improve both statistical and other analytical processes, and to better visualize data to decision-makers. Several key attributes involving poverty were noted, both income- and non-income-related. The different provinces of Iraq were compared by weighted overlay of these indicators into one poverty metric, and then compared over time, to before and after the 2003 Iraq War, which had devastating impact to the economy of Iraq and to Iraqi individuals. The study also lays out a process flow for the government to use for poverty alleviation using GIS data.</p>

			This study compares demographic socioeconomic indicators of poverty such as unemployment rate, residential instability, and racial and immigrant status, with proximity to HIV-related services in the Toronto area. The demographic indicators were culled from a much larger list using statistical techniques e.g. principal component and factor analysis, and the quartiles were mapped by census tract. At the same time, HIV-service locations were mapped and each census tract centroid was measured to the nearest HIV center. The distances for each census tract were then mapped by quartile as well. In the results of the analysis, more disadvantaged communities close to the city center were very well served by HIV centers while many neighborhoods on the periphery had little access to HIV services. The demographic factors that correlated with poverty were different between the city center and the peripheries, which can allow decision-makers to target new services at particular socioeconomic groups.</p>

		<p class="text">
			This study investigates the spatial difference in motivations for urban gardening, finding that among more economically-advantaged groups, urban agriculture is done more for environmental responsibility and among more disadvantaged groups, urban agriculture is done more often for food security and cost-saving measures. The methodology of this study was multi-dimensional, incorporating remote sensing, demographic census data, ground truthing via physically traveling along roadways in several sample areas, and two sets of mailed surveys. The remote sensing data tended to have few false positives, but missed a large percentage of gardens due to high tree canopy cover, as calibrated by the ground-truthing. However, it was able to identify differences between the three distinguished areas of the Portland metro area, between average garden size, location of gardens (whether front gardens or back/side gardens), and relative clustering of gardened areas.</p>

		<p class="text">
			This study provides a novel approach to classifying poverty, along non-monetary lines and multiple dimensions such as sanitation, health care, shelter, and education. These metrics were used for this specific Vietnamese case, to concentrate only on metrics that actually contributed to poorer outcomes. The study also differentiated on a child-by-child basis, which was possible because of the particular data set used. This meant that each child could be evaluated based on all the available criteria and the aggregate data existed for all the individual criteria. Since most studies on poverty concentrate on monetary poverty, this provides another example of a multi-faceted approach to allow for the complexities of individual situations.</p>

		<p class="text">
			This is the newest of my sources, and is the culmination of the work of many of the other authors here. This is a full integration of GIS, demographic data, multicriteria decision analysis, and insights into the particular needs of the community in question. The drylands of Argentina have poverty indicators radically different from those of urban populations, and even from most rural populations that are agriculture-based. Factors such as number of goats owned per person, water access, and electrical access are some of the largest drivers of poverty, and the most helpful unit of analysis is the livestock station. This necessarily ignores disparities of situations between multiple households that might be sharing the same station, but this information is readily available and can be tracked over time. The authors' methodology is helpful as an analog, but the thought process of approaching communities with their particularities in mind is even more helpful.</p>

			This source operates as a primer on Evidence-Based Practice in social programs for child welfare, from the agency level to the individual. It goes through all phases of analysis, decision, and impletmentation, with practical advice to both prevent and acknowledge bias, while still recognizing the need to adjust programs to fit the needs of specific communities. It begins by convincing the reader of the need for evidence-based practice, then quickly goes into the details of adjusting the process to incorporate more evidence-based practice and intervention, considering all the overlapping contexts of the program, such as the community, local historical and political contexts, and amount of training of aid workers along with other organizational contexts. The paper seeks to provide a pragmatic approach that recognizes and acknowledges uncertainty, making it fully transparent.</p>

			This study uses GIS and spatial autocorrelation to compare two theories of disadvantage: primarily racial or primarily class-based. This particular study focused on location of Superfund sites relative to census tracts with varying amounts of segregation, and those with varying levels of economic hardship. The results of the study found that segregation played a less important role than expected, and that location of superfund sites correlated very well with poorer neighborhoods. However, a key finding of the study is that of those poorer neighborhoods, majority-Black neighborhoods were far likelier to house Superfund sites. This study uses real geographic data to evaluate classical sociological theories based on anecdotal accounts, showing the use of integration of spatial data to demographics.</p>

			This study focuses on two communities, the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area, and the St. Louis metro area. Only the St. Louis example incorporates GIS into its analysis. In St. Louis, biotech is a burgeoning industry, and the study attempted to find if residents local to biotech company locations would have the ability to participate in the benefits of having the locations near them. Using Kernel Density Estimation to find clustering of biotech company locations and nearest-neighbor analysis along poverty indicators such as educational attainment, unemployment, and free or reduced lunch numbers, it was found that the large clusters of biotech companies in the urban core primarily provided jobs to those in nearby suburbs, while the residents of the urban core did not have opportunities to get those jobs. This mapping of opportunities rather than outcomes is one of the primary differences in methodology for mapping poverty, and it is important to take note of both methods when trying to create a new system of metrics in a new area.</p>

			This short paper details the process of creating a new spatial database specifically targeting poverty data in China, both its spatial and non-spatial components. The focus is on the data architecture and how it is intended to be used. The principle parts of a spatial data framework are detailed, with the spatially located data, statistical data, and administrative data combined based on location. This "data layer" is then transferred into a "business application layer" that involves querying, analysis, and database maintenance, and finally into a "presentation layer" that focuses on getting information to users and decision makers.</p>

			This study analyzes water poverty in a beach tourism community in Senegal. Statistical techniques were used on poverty indicators such as heather strip burning, water access, water quality, income, and habitat change. These distributions were then incorporated into thematic mapping to correlate the other poverty indicators with water access. Water stress was highest among those paying for water, although residents who got water for free from wells had to cope with more polluted water. In this study, a majority of the population had very low water access. This is somewhat counter-intuitive as this is a tourist town which has seen a lot of growth, although a possible reason this hasn't advantaged the residents is that new developments tend to take up the existing water supply rather than increasing the total supply.</p>

			This study uses modern GIS techniques to analyze highly detailed poverty maps of London's East End created in 1889, looking for trends and comparing them to modern maps. The study found that in general more affluent people lived on longer and busier streets, which fits the class distinctions of the time where the middle classes were skilled tradespeople who would have wanted to attract customers. These long and busy streets are still the focus of greater wealth today, and shorter, more cramped streets are still much more economically disadvantaged. These more poverty-prone areas are theorized to result from a literal lack of mobility, involving a lack of access to the economic drivers of the city. These effects would be an overprint on other drivers of poverty, not a full replacement. However, this is an effect usually impossible to track since poverty at a house and street level is very hard to measure in today's developed world. Class tended to change quickly from street to street, and these would all be in similar census tracts today. These would be the equivalent of "mixels" in our raster terminology.</p>
