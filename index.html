		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p class="text">
			There has been a recent challenge for the GIS community from former Oregon governor Kitzhaber, to help fight the roots of child poverty using GIS tools. The idea is to provide a spatial framework for aid organizations to integrate their efforts and pinpoint problem areas. Living in Portland myself, I am interested in exploring the sources of poverty in the city, as well as possible actions to mediate them.</p>
		<p class="text">
			I have assembled the following annotated bibliography to collect efforts to use GIS to solve poverty problems, as well as some Portland-specific studies. Please use the links at the bottom of the page to submit questions or comments.</p>

			This paper attempts to formalize a conceptual data model for poverty studies, describing the linkage between spatial and non-spatial characteristics of individual entities, e.g. roads or neighborhoods, with their attributes, e.g. flood risk or education level. This linkage is divided into three types of relationships: relational within the database, topological, and spatially derived. This data model concept is derived from numerous other existant poverty studies, but it is noted that any conceptual framework must be tested by users to make sure it is useful.</p>

			This introduction to a collection of multi-dimension poverty studies outlines the major currently used multi-dimensional method of understanding the intricacies of poverty, the Alkire-Foster method. This method involves evaluating the amount of deprivation along one indicator and whether it meets a particular cutoff. The number of deprived indicators for each individual is counted and that is then turned into one data point, which is then aggregated to population level. This allows the data set to be composed of multiple partial-poverty indicators, so that it can be sliced and diced along many different poverty axes. This method is cited and used by many if not all workers in the multi-dimensional poverty space. This particular paper goes through the intricacies of the modeling and aggregation methodologies, as a guide for others.</p>

			This paper re-approaches the concept of the food desert - an area of a city more than a mile from a grocery store, by introducing the price point of healthy food. In Portland, many gentrifying neighborhoods are adding grocery stores with higher price points to serve the new affluent residents, turning food deserts into "food mirages." The availability of low-cost grocery stores was mapped out, and it was discovered that 81% of low-income residents live more than a mile from low-cost stores, putting them into the food mirage category, and 20% of low-income residents live more than a mile from any grocery store, putting them into true food deserts. Food deserts were concentrated east of I-205, while food mirages were concentrated in the close-in Eastside. The Westside of Portland tends to have fewer low-income residents and so the higher-priced grocery stores have less effect. This reinterpretation provides a real paradigm change in the way we think about food justice in cities.</p>

			This survey report documents the history of poverty in Portland as well as the efforts to reduce its impacts. Portland is referenced as a "best case" for urban poverty, with its history of progressive activism and policy. The existing inequalities are compared as relatively similar to national averages, while lower than those of other cities. Portland's major inequality problems are not concentrated in urban centers like other cities, but spread out because of high amounts of gentrification. This serves as a great foundational document for any further study I do of Portland poverty.</p>

			This source is an internal government report making observations about trends in the child welfare / foster care system along racial lines. Other studies have shown that entry into the foster care system was the biggest predictor of poorer outcomes for children down the road, so racial disparities, which were found in this study, are of particular importance. Significantly, this study is purely observational and does not attempt to identify any causal relationships. Perhaps geographic analysis could be used to find helpful correlations.</p>

			This article is a case study, and really an ethnography, of the homeless community known as Dignity Village, established in the Portland metro area. It documents the history of the Village, as well as its purposes of educating both its members and the public, providing a safe haven for those first entering homelessness, and acting as an example of self-sufficiency among the homeless population. The author worked closely with the leadership of the Village, and acted to provide grants as well as grant-writing skills to Village members. The partnership between the Village and the author's university (University of Washington, Vancouver,) also included technology teaching events to provide residents with abilities to apply for jobs online and manage finances with spreadsheets. Since many children who go through the foster care system end up homeless at some point in their lives, understanding alternative methods of coping with the burdens of homelessness and routes out of it is crucial.</p>

			This study focused on integrating collected census data into a GIS along with remote sensing data with training classification, using a combination of RADARSAT and Landsat Thematic Mapper. The study combined a GIS of city blocks with the tabulated census data, mostly involving floor and roofing materials and number of inhabitants per room. These were then converted to a poverty metric. The remote sensing data was given supervised training to distinguish land use, which was then merged with the census data. The result yielded two already-known pockets of poverty, and identified ten more areas that were then corroborated. This shows a real case study where a combination of remote sensing and ground data were used to extrapolate areas in need from known areas.</p>

			This is primarily a case study of successfully integrating tabular data into a GIS in order to improve both statistical and other analytical processes, and to better visualize data to decision-makers. Several key attributes involving poverty were noted, both income- and non-income-related. The different provinces of Iraq were compared by weighted overlay of these indicators into one poverty metric, and then compared over time, to before and after the 2003 Iraq War, which had devastating impact to the economy of Iraq and to Iraqi individuals. The study also lays out a process flow for the government to use for poverty alleviation using GIS data.</p>

			This study compares demographic socioeconomic indicators of poverty such as unemployment rate, residential instability, and racial and immigrant status, with proximity to HIV-related services in the Toronto area. The demographic indicators were culled from a much larger list using statistical techniques e.g. principal component and factor analysis, and the quartiles were mapped by census tract. At the same time, HIV-service locations were mapped and each census tract centroid was measured to the nearest HIV center. The distances for each census tract were then mapped by quartile as well. In the results of the analysis, more disadvantaged communities close to the city center were very well served by HIV centers while many neighborhoods on the periphery had little access to HIV services. The demographic factors that correlated with poverty were different between the city center and the peripheries, which can allow decision-makers to target new services at particular socioeconomic groups.</p>

			This study investigates the spatial difference in motivations for urban gardening, finding that among more economically-advantaged groups, urban agriculture is done more for environmental responsibility and among more disadvantaged groups, urban agriculture is done more often for food security and cost-saving measures. The methodology of this study was multi-dimensional, incorporating remote sensing, demographic census data, ground truthing via physically traveling along roadways in several sample areas, and two sets of mailed surveys. The remote sensing data tended to have few false positives, but missed a large percentage of gardens due to high tree canopy cover, as calibrated by the ground-truthing. However, it was able to identify differences between the three distinguished areas of the Portland metro area, between average garden size, location of gardens (whether front gardens or back/side gardens), and relative clustering of gardened areas.</p>

			This study provides a novel approach to classifying poverty, along non-monetary lines and multiple dimensions such as sanitation, health care, shelter, and education. These metrics were used for this specific Vietnamese case, to concentrate only on metrics that actually contributed to poorer outcomes. The study also differentiated on a child-by-child basis, which was possible because of the particular data set used. This meant that each child could be evaluated based on all the available criteria and the aggregate data existed for all the individual criteria. Since most studies on poverty concentrate on monetary poverty, this provides another example of a multi-faceted approach to allow for the complexities of individual situations.</p>
